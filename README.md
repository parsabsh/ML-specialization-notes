# Machine Learning Specialization Notes

My notes on Coursera's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) course by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and [Stanford online](https://online.stanford.edu/) taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) **in less than 50 pages** (PDF + LaTeX code available)

There are two options to access the PDF and LaTex code:

1. Clone this github repository
2. Check out this [Overleaf Project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxhrdpqgpnzs)

These are the tools I have used in this project:

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/)
- [latexdraw](https://latexdraw.com/)

**Call for contribution:** Some optional topics of the third course are not included in this project. If you are willing to add these sections to the project please feel free to contribute in one of the following ways:

1. Pull request in GitHub
2. Collaborate on Overleaf (reach me at m.p.bashari@gmail.com so I can add you to the list of collaborators)
